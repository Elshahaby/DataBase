## What is Database?

is a collection of related data.
A database represents some aspect of the real world.

### Types Of DataBase

### Data management System (DBMS)

A database management system(DBMS) is a collection of programs that enables users to creat and maintain a database. The DBMS is a general-purpose <br> software system that facilitates the processes of defining , constructing ,mainipulating,and sharing DB among applications

1. ### Defining a database

   involves specifiyinh the data types,structures and constranints of the <br> data to be stored by the DBMS on the form of a database catalog or dictionary; it is called (meta-data).

1. ### Constructing the database =>

   is the process of storing the data on some storage medium that is controlled by the DBMS. <br>

1. ### Manipulation a database =>

   inculdes functions such as querying the DB to retrieve specific data,<br> updating the DB to reflect changed in the mimiworld and generating reports from the data.

1. ### Sharing a database =>
   allow multiple users and programs to access the datavase simultaneously.

<br>

- An application program accesses the database by sending queries or request <br> for data to the DBMS.
  <br>
- a query: causes some data to be retrieved.
  <br>
- transaction : may cause some data to be read and some data to be written
  into database.
  <br>
- provide a Protection :-
  system protection -> to the data against hardware or software malfunction
  security protection -> aganist unauthorized or malicious access.

## Disadvantages of File processing

- program-Data Dependence
- Duplication of Data
- Limited Data Sharing
- lengthy Development Times
- Excessive program Maintenance

## Characteristics of the Database Approach

### 1. self-describing nature of a database system

### 2. insulation between programs and data, and data abstraction

### 3. support of multiple views of the data (depend on what user interest)
